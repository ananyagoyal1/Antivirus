# Antivirus Program Examples

This repository contains examples of implementing various components of an antivirus program in Java. These examples are intended for educational purposes and to illustrate different concepts and techniques used in antivirus software development.

## Examples

1. **Basic Antivirus Program Structure**
   - File: `AntivirusProgram.java`
   - Description: A basic structure for an antivirus program that includes file scanning, signature database management, and file quarantine functionality.

2. **Heuristic Analysis**
   - File: `HeuristicAnalysis.java`
   - Description: An example of implementing basic heuristic analysis for detecting potential malware based on code patterns and suspicious strings.

3. **File System Monitoring**
   - File: `FileSystemMonitor.java`
   - Description: An example of monitoring the file system for changes (file creation, modification, deletion) and scanning the affected files in real-time using the `java.nio.file.WatchService` class.

4. **Antivirus GUI**
   - File: `AntivirusGUI.java`
   - Description: A simple graphical user interface (GUI) for the antivirus program built using Java Swing, allowing users to initiate scans and view log messages.

## Usage

These examples are standalone Java files and can be compiled and run individually. However, they are meant to be used as reference or building blocks for a more comprehensive antivirus program.

To run an example, you can compile the Java file using the `javac` command and then execute the compiled class file using the `java` command. For example:

```
javac AntivirusProgram.java
java AntivirusProgram
```
